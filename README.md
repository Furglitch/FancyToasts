# Changelog 📝

## 1.4.5.1
* Bug fixes:
  * Memory leak due to lack of unsubscribing from events (sorry)
  * FTBQuests compatibility:
    * Quest not being rendered if there are multiple icons
    * Custom textures causes just empty icon frame (now by default there is a fallback as a `Quest Book` for icon)
* Adjustments:
  * Updated Simplified Chinese language by Gao Xinyang (`zh_cn`)
  * FTBQuests compatibility:
    * There is now 3-minute window between repeatable quests, so they don't spam the screen
  * Default positions for different anchors (suggested by Redls07)
  * Inverted `y` position (`50` is now `-50`), because it just makes more sense
  * New config version system (for easier migrating in the future, so configs don't reset to default when updated version)

## v1.4.5
* New features:
  * Advancements filtering! Can be changed types of advancements, toasts and even specific advancement or whole categories to enable/disable

  * Custom textures are now loaded until the last toast using it is shown. Prevents missing textures and memory leaks
  * Splashes
  * Settings screens aren't closed after saving. It's for easier tweaking of toasts' position and etc.
  * Better visual settings UI
  * Better translations (in term of keys, and maybe slightly improved English version)
  * Toast Control won't disable Fancy Toasts anymore, but they still conflict
